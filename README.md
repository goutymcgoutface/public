# Introduction & Background
I've recently been diagnosed with [gout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout), at the tender age (at time of writing) of ~35. Following inspiration from [this post](https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss) regarding the use of [Vowpal wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) to, in essence, use regression to understand the impact of diet and lifestyle on weightloss, I plan to adapt it to understand the impact of diet and lifestyle choices on my uric acid levels, the seemingly determinant factor in suffering from gout. 

## Initalisation -- About me & this project
### Me
White male, born early 1980's

### Disease history
At time of writing, I've experienced three acute gout attacks:

1. 2012: Following running. 
2. 2106: Following _barefoot_ running. (There was an issue getting the Vibrams onto my right foot, where I bent the right "ring" toe underneath the foot, effectively trapping it in the shoe, and then having to stand on it. Following walking on this foot awkwardly over the following days, this seemed to induce an acute gout response)
3. 2017: Eating three meals consisting of seafood in succession:
    * Sushi, and two glasses of red wine -- note that I was mostly teetotal for ~6weeks prior to this point
    * Crayfish salad
    * Haddock

### Diagnosis & pharmacotherapy

# Protocol

## Method & Approach

# Open loops
* How will regression deal with potential time delay of change in uric acid levels? E.g. imagine that one beer is drunk on day 1, but the resulting change in uric acid occurs on day 4. (Ask RowChief about this)
* What's the timeline for metabolising purines to uric acid?
* Is there any value in being genetically screened for the particular mutation? (If you had this though, what would you do with the knowledge?)
